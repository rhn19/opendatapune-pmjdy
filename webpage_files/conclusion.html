This project has been undertaken to study the PMJDY program in all the Banks in India and to find out the steps taken by the banks in the area of Financial Inclusion. The main objectives of the research were to identify the approaches adopted by different banks and to know about the customer response towards the banking approaches under financial inclusion program.
</br></br>The study concluded that <strong><em>though the banks are complying with RBI norms in terms of opening branches, offering no frills account, kisan credit card, simplifying KYC norms, but still is lot of effort to be put in for financial inclusion progress</strong></em>. <em>Biometric cards</em> should be introduced for security in transactions as well as saving time. Business correspondents should be employed in villages and trained in advance for promoting financial inclusion program. <strong>Banks need to open its more branches within rural areas and creating more awareness about banking services among rural people by telling them about the benefits of the banking services</strong>. Financial inclusion requires efforts on the parts of three parties- RBI, all the banks as well as general public for its better progress.</br>
